<p> Los enlaces o hipervínculos, también llamados hipertextos son los textos o los objetos sobre los que podemos hacer clic para que nos lleven a otra parte del documento, a otra página web en el mismo sitio o a otra página de Internet, entre otras funciones.</p>

<p>Cuando un visitante hace clic en el hipervínculo, el destino se mostrará en su navegador web, se abrirá o se ejecutará, en función del tipo de destino. El destino es con frecuencia otra página web, pero también puede ser una imagen, un archivo multimedia, un documento de Microsoft Office, un documento PDF, una dirección de correo electrónico o un programa.</p>

<p>Por tanto, con los hipervínculos podemos establecer “saltos” desde una página a otra, incluso a puntos concretos dentro de páginas con contenidos extensos. Los hipervínculos pueden asociarse a imágenes o a textos de modo que haciendo clic sobre ellos con el botón izquierdo del ratón se accede automáticamente al destino asociado a ellos.</p>

	<h2>HIPERVINCULOS LOCALES</h2>
	<p>Hipervínculo local o interno: Un hipervínculo local o interno es un vínculo a una página que se encuentra en el mismo sitio web (sitio local). Así, para referirnos a ella tan solo basta con poner la ruta o dirección en el disco duro. Si se encuentra en la misma carpeta, basta con poner su nombre.</p>

	<h2>HIPERVINCULOS REMOTOS </h2>
	<p>Un hipervínculo externo es un vínculo a otro sitio web en Internet (sitio externo). Es un vínculo a cualquier otro lugar fuera del sitio actual. Cuando ponemos un vínculo externo, escribimos la dirección completa de la página incluido http://www.</p>

<p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
